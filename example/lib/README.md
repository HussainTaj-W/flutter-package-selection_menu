# Example Series

These examples gradually build on previous ones. It is recommended that
you read them in sequence.

Almost each folder is an example. There is a README file that highlights
the syntax used and briefly explains it. Also provides a picture of the
end result, so you don't have to run the code yourself.

The code files themselves have extensive comments that explain the
concepts.

If at any moment something is not clear, please refer to the API 
documentation available [here](TODO).
